# Don't Get Rusty

A structured Rust learning project designed to help you progress from beginner to advanced concepts in Rust programming.

Slapped this together with some Ai help, so it's not perfect. Decent for practicing some Rust concepts, but not a replacement for a real project and real world experience.

## Project Structure

This project is organized into three main sections:

### Beginner Level
- Variables and basic types
- Control flow (if/else, loops, match)
- Functions and closures

### Intermediate Level
- Ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes
- Collections (Vectors, HashMaps)
- Error handling with Result and Option
- Traits and generics

### Advanced Level
- Concurrency and async/await
- Macros and metaprogramming
- Unsafe Rust
- Foreign Function Interface (FFI)

## How to Use This Project

1. Start with the beginner exercises in `src/beginner/`
2. Complete each module in order
3. Try to solve the exercises without looking at the solutions
4. Progress to intermediate and advanced concepts as you become comfortable

## Answer Guides

If you get stuck or want to verify your solutions, answer guides are available in each section:

- Beginner answers: `src/beginner/answers.md`
- Intermediate answers: `src/intermediate/answers.md`
- Advanced answers: `src/advanced/answers.md`

Each answer guide contains complete solutions with explanations. However, it's recommended to:
1. Try solving the exercises yourself first
2. Only look at the answers when you're stuck
3. Use the answers to understand different approaches
4. Experiment with modifying the solutions

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Rust installed (https://rustup.rs/)
2. Clone this repository
3. Run `cargo build` to ensure everything compiles
4. Start with `src/beginner/variables.rs`

## Tips for Learning

- Read the comments in each file carefully
- Try to modify the examples to see what happens
- When stuck, use `cargo doc --open` to read the documentation
- Experiment with the code and make mistakes - that's how you learn!
- If you're stuck, check the answer guides but try to understand the solutions
